- Jael should keep a key revision history for me so I don't need to build %pki-store
- Jael should sign things for me so I don't have to store private keys in my state
- Crub is basically impossible to use in anger without reading the code, which is opaque

less relevant:
- Hoon should recognize that I made a recursive type instead of just looping and crashing
